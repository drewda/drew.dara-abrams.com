<p><strong>Hello from the San Francisco Bay Area</strong>. This is where I'm originally from, and while life has taken me elsewhere along the way, it's where I call home.</p>

<p>I consult on transportation data, platforms, and products. My work emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>software that is open-source</li>
    <li>data that is open</li>
    <li>transportation that is multi-modal (especially public mass transit, walking, cycling, and "shared" modes)</li>
    <li>platforms and partnerships that are collaborative</li>
    <li>users modeled as computational agents or studied in controlled experiments &mdash; within a broader context of being seen as real, whole people</li>
    <li>good transportation as a means to increase our access to livelihood, happiness, health, family, and friends</li>
</ul>

<p>From 2014 to 2017, I served as Head of Mobility Products at <a href="https://mapzen.com">Mapzen</a>, a geospatial software and data R&D start-up sponsored by Samsung. While at Mapzen, I:
<ul>
    <li>founded the <a href="https://transit.land">Transitland</a> platform.</li>
    <li>product-managed the growth of the <a href="https://github.com/valhalla">Valhalla</a> routing engine, especially the additions of isochrone, map-matching, and other analysis functionality.</li>
    <li>led Mapzen's successful bid and effort to built the <a href="http://opentraffic.io">Open Traffic</a> platform under contract for The World Bank.</li>
    <li>recruited and collaborated with many talented colleagues</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Previously, I earned a Ph.D. from the <a href="https://geog.ucsb.edu/">Department of Geography</a> at University of California, Santa Barbara. I have served as Chief Technology Officer for a series of start-ups related to transportation, urban planning, and support for senior citizens.</p>
